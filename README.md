# INDIA-OSINT-Framework

- This is one out of many localized OSINT Framework pages that I have been working on for specific countries.
- This is where I gather and organize all OSINT resources for locale India.
- Dont take things to serious - its public information after all. 
- Big thanks goes out to cursor, my mom and all my stalkers.
